# docker-local-repo

Simple bash script to retain last x number of images for each repo when hosting images locally

# Pre-requisites

The script assumes that a "local" Docker registry is already running on the same machine as the machine running the main repoclean.sh script. Details of running a local Docker registry can be found here
